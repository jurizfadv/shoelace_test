  TODO
  5. If everything is complete remove label "Estimated Completion". See # 10
  7. If an element is canceled or disabled it should not factor into the progress.
  10. Change label to "Completed" and date must reflect the completed date. Is that stored somewhere?

  NOTE:
  Will I need a function to determine the "furthest" date based on a series of supplied dates or is that
  handled on the backend? Currently assuming the data is passed "as is" and the frontend will need to determine
  the date furthest forward.

  This function can also identify non-dates and take some action based on the information. For instance
  if no date is supplied ECD = "unknown". If a date has passed ECD = "delayed".
